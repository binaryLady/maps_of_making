# Deferred Work

## Deferred from: code review of 1-3-docker-compose-stack-nginx-security-routing (2026-04-24)

- **Docker images not pinned to specific versions** — `infra/link_handler/Dockerfile` uses `python:3.12-slim` (no patch pin); `docker-compose.yml` uses `:latest` tags. Future deploys may break silently.
- **CORS `*` overly permissive on /sparql/query** — Intentional for public endpoint now; consider restricting to known origins when admin/write paths are added in Epic 5.
- **LINK_SECRET env var never consumed in stub** — Passed to mak-link-handler but ignored until Epic 3 (Story 3.3) implements actual HMAC token signing.
- **nginx /claim/ has minimal proxy headers** — Missing `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-Host`. Full headers needed when claim handler does origin-aware logic in Epic 3.
- **No SPARQL query complexity limits / DoS protection** — No timeout or depth limit on public /sparql/query. Add nginx `limit_req` or oxigraph timeout config in future infra hardening story.
- **No graceful shutdown timeout for uvicorn** — Single-worker stub; add `--timeout-graceful-shutdown 30` when claim handler processes real transactions in Epic 3.
- **gateway network external precondition not verified** — `docker-compose up` fails if hetzner-gateway network doesn't exist. Add to VPS setup runbook.
- **nginx starts before upstreams are ready (early 502s on cold start)** — On `docker compose up -d`, first few requests may hit 502. Acceptable for current scale; add startup ordering with `condition: service_healthy` sweep if SLA requires cold-start reliability.
- **No upstream fallback for oxigraph or mak-link-handler downtime** — Bare 502 on upstream failure. Add `error_page 502 /50x.html` or upstream backup when resilience becomes a requirement.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-5-map-reads-from-oxigraph-geojson-materialization (2026-04-25)

- **Fixed temp filename `.geojson.tmp`** — `scripts/materialize_geojson.py`: concurrent invocations write to the same temp file, last writer wins then renames. Low risk while manually invoked; becomes real when Epic 3 scheduler triggers materialize on each ingest cycle. Fix: use `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` in the same directory.
- **GROUP_CONCAT `|` separator** — SPARQL query uses `|` as separator for specialties. A specialty containing `|` (possible with user-supplied data in Epic 2) will be split incorrectly. Epic 2 normalization pass should enforce no-pipe constraint in specialty values.
- **countryLabel() only handles FR/DE** — `web/app.js`: all other countries display raw ISO codes (e.g. `BE`, `NL`). Needs a full country lookup map. Defer to Epic 5 UI polish.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-4-author-mom-ontology-v0-load-mom-iop-into-oxigraph (2026-04-24)

- **distrobox fallback silent failure when container not running** — `scripts/load_ontology.sh`: if `maps-oxigraph` is not running, `podman inspect` fails silently, `CONTAINER_IP` is empty, script proceeds with the original unreachable URL without a clear diagnostic error message.
- **No `--max-time` on curl PUTs in load_ontology.sh** — load script can hang indefinitely on slow VPS or stalled container; health check has `-m 1` but actual PUT calls don't.

## Deferred from: Story 2.0 — UI Dataset Toggle and User Preferences (2026-04-25)

- **Legend does not show health map states** — `web/maps-of-making.html`: legend only lists seeded/confirmed/open/unlinked/broken. When health map is ON, aging ⚠️ / zombie 🧟 / dead 🪦 markers appear with no legend entry. Add a conditional legend section that shows when health map is active. → Epic 5 UI polish.
- **Status filter chips don't include health states** — `web/app.js` `buildFilterChips()`: statuses array is `['seeded','confirmed','open','unlinked','broken']`. When health map is ON, users can't filter by aging/zombie/dead. → Epic 5 (Story 5-5 tweaks panel decision).
- **Emoji in SVG markers: cross-browser rendering risk** — aging/zombie/dead markers use SVG `<text>` with emoji (⚠️🧟🪦). Rendering is browser/OS-dependent; may be invisible or misaligned on some Android WebViews. Replace with inline SVG glyphs if reported. → monitor, fix if bug reported.

## Deferred from: code review of Story 2.0 (2026-04-26)

- **Orphaned selected marker after GeoJSON reload** — Selection state in UI diverges from GeoJSON state if selection changes during reload. Requires larger state management refactor. → Epic 5 architecture pass.
- **DOM race: highlightSelected() async to renderMarkers()** — Visual glitch on slow networks when highlight called before tiles render. Timing issue from initial architecture, not introduced by this story. → Epic 5 rendering optimization.
- **geolocationFidelity enum not validated** — Future features using fidelity-based filtering will silently break on invalid enum values. Requires schema validation layer in SPARQL or backend. → Epic 2/5 data validation scope.
- **Search with untrusted data** — Specialty field concatenated directly into search haystack with no sanitization. Low risk in text search context but fragile pattern for future features. → Data validation and trust boundary refactor (Epic 2 scope).
